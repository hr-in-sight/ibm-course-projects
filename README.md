This repository contains my personal solutions and practice notebooks from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera, course 5 'Python Project for Data Science'.

As part of the final assignment, I extracted and visualized financial data for **Tesla** and **GameStop** using `yfinance` and `webscraping` techniques. The goal was to analyze stock performance and quarterly revenue using Python.
